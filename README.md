# Catching-AI-survey-bots
Machine learning project - bot


## Project Overview
The "Catching AI Survey Bots" project is designed to identify and analyze the behavior of AI survey bots using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes a dataset of McDonald's store reviews to develop predictive models that can differentiate between human and AI-generated responses.

## Introduction
With the rise of AI technologies, distinguishing between human and bot interactions has become increasingly important. This project aims to provide insights into how AI bots operate and offers tools to detect them effectively.

## Dataset
The primary dataset used in this project is the **McDonald's Store Reviews** dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/mcdonalds-store-reviews). This dataset contains various reviews that will be utilized to train and test the predictive model.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (or any compatible IDE)
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/catching-ai-survey-bots.git
   cd catching-ai-survey-bots
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the analysis and model training.
